### About Me

Currently a Red Hat Software Engineer working on Data Protection on OpenShift platform.

Computer Programming and Industrial Engineering Undergraduate at North Carolina State University graduating in May 2021

I live and breath technology. I'd like to think I have explored the world but there's still more room yet for more. I have lived more than a couple of years in Thailand (where I am from), New Zealand (where I finish high-schooling), and the United States (where I completes my Undergraduate degree). 

Talk to me about the latest gadgets, new undersea cable, a new cloud platform launching, and other exciting technological breakthroughs.

In red below are some places I have lived in, visited, or transited through. Screenshot from Google Maps' Timeline
